## Summary
We find the resistance between two points in a finite, square resistor grid as an approximation to that resistance in an infinite resistor grid. The problem is closely related to solving the Poisson equation by the finite difference method. By varying grid size we see convergence of the finite-difference solution to the known analytic solution for a specific separation of nodes ($\Delta$i = 2, $\Delta$j = 1) where the position of the node on the grid is represented by (i,j). The method is perhaps not as elegant as the analytic one but it is considerably easier to perform and extend to different node pairs.
